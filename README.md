## Overview
This repository represents the Agency FHIR implementation guide for the Profile Library.

## Formulation
Most profiles have been formally derived from the HL7 Australia [Australian Base Profiles Implementation Guide](http://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-base/index.html). The remaining profiles are directly based on the [FHIR STU3 specification](http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/index.html) (v3.0.1).

Subsequent constraints and updates have been made to various elements using the [Forge STU3 tool](https://fhir.furore.com/forge/).

And final outputs have been created using the FHIR IG Publishing tool.

## Components
This IG is made up of profiles of the following resources models:
* Patient
* Practitioner
* Practitioner Role
* Related Person
* Organization
* Device

And profiles of the following complex datatypes:
* HumanName
